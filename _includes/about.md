I am [Rahul Kadyan](http://rahulkadyan.com), a software engineer attending [Google Summer of Code 2014 (GSoC)](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2014).



GSoC is a program promoted by Google in which organizations and students work together on free and open-source coding projects for 3 months. I was selected by INCF and I'll be working on [EEGBase](http://eegdatabase.kiv.zcu.cz/)'s [android client](https://github.com/NEUROINFORMATICS-GROUP-FAV-KIV-ZCU/eeg-database-for-android/releases) in the period May 19 - August 18. My mentor is [Petr Je≈æek](https://github.com/jezekp).



[EEGBase](http://eegdatabase.kiv.zcu.cz/) is a system for storage and management of EEG/ERP resources - data, metadata, tools and materials related to EEG/ERP experiments. [EEGBase](http://eegdatabase.kiv.zcu.cz/) advances electrophysiology research by enabling access to public data, tools and results of research groups.



[EEGBase](http://eegdatabase.kiv.zcu.cz/) is written mainly in Java and the code is hosted on [github](https://github.com/NEUROINFORMATICS-GROUP-FAV-KIV-ZCU). I am working on android client also hosted on [github](https://github.com/NEUROINFORMATICS-GROUP-FAV-KIV-ZCU/eeg-database-for-android) and my code is in the forked [repository](https://github.com/rahulkadyan/eeg-database-for-android).
